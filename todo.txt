Pulblicize

* Format for README.md
* Post on github
* Post on mvnrepo
* Blog a bit

Overall
* Add more to the package doc.
* Add tests and move SomeGraph to tests

Structures

* MultiPath representation (Probably a subgraph via having)
* Concurrent Graph (Or at least Graph-With-Concurrently-Modifiable-Edges)
* Fibonacci heap

Algorithms

* Dijkstra's algorithm
* Dijkstra with a Fibonacci heap
* Basic betweenness and closeness
* Efficient betweenness and closeness
* Lazy Label Graph. (Single-Source graph)
* A* algorithm
* Parallel queued minimization
* Minimum spanning trees

Semirings

* Most probable Semiring
* Combined Semirings.

Figure out

* path representations on the original graph with hyperedges and multiple edges.
