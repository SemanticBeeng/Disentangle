In this release

* Cleaned up IndexedSet
* scala-graph in a separate subproject

* Rename project  -- Scala Untangled ? Disentangler

* automatically plot the results of the timing studies (and comparison with Jung)
** Benchmark writes a file of things to compare, automatically read from plotBenchmarks - a plot and runAndPlot target
** File also determines if plot is svg segment or html page
** Automatically open a browser to show the page at the end of the benchmark -- create a new target to chain them all together.
** Scala.js/node.js command line as a separate project.

* Timing data on EC2 big machine
** Test and script on cheap machine
** Automate git add, commit, push
** Run on a big spot instance
* Parallel Dijkstra, Brandes
** Run on a big spot instance

Next release

* IndexedSubSet backed by BitSet
* Louvain algorithm

* Subgraph representation ?

Later

* More Enron
* path representation for net.walend.graph
* translator from net.walend.graph.path to scala-graph's paths
* Prim's MST algorithm


Pulblicize

* Blog a bit

Overall
* Add more to the package doc.

Structures

* MultiPath representation (Probably a subgraph via having)
* Concurrent Graph (Or at least Graph-With-Concurrently-Modifiable-Edges)

Algorithms

* AllPathsBrandes which finds all minimal paths between start and end nodes by supplying a set of possible previous nodes within an Option[BrandesSteps] (currently can only use one Semiring)
* MST with Fibonacci heap
* Lazy Label Graph. (Single-Source graph with Dijkstra's algorithm)
* A* algorithm
* Parallel queued graph minimization (will need a concurrent mutable edge graph)


Semirings

* More Semirings

Figure out

* path representations on the original graph with hyperedges and multiple edges.

Prim's MST algorithm

Put all the verticies in a priority queue with variable key values
Initialize all the keys to O.
Pick the root and set its key to I.
While the queue is not empty
    extract the minimum edge and node
        if the node isn't in the MST
            for each node reachable from it not currently in the MST
                if some node is closer by using this node
                    replace the key with the closer value
