In this release

* Cleaned up IndexedSet
* scala-graph in a separate subproject

* Rename project - Disentangle

* Graphs of results from benchmark

* Timing data on EC2 big machine
** Test and script on cheap machine
** Run on a big instance
** Graph results

* Parallel Dijkstra,

* Parallel Brandes
** Run on a big instance
* examples subproject (With enron data)

Next release

* Undirected graphs
** With Brandes' algorithm
* Louvain algorithm
* IndexedSubSet backed by BitSet

* Subgraph representation ?

Later

* More Enron
* path representation for net.walend.graph
* translator from net.walend.graph.path to scala-graph's paths
* Prim's MST algorithm


Pulblicize

* Blog a bit

Overall
* Add more to the package doc.

Structures

* MultiPath representation (Probably a subgraph via having)
* Concurrent Graph (Or at least Graph-With-Concurrently-Modifiable-Edges)

Algorithms

* AllPathsBrandes which finds all minimal paths between start and end nodes by supplying a set of possible previous nodes within an Option[BrandesSteps] (currently can only use one Semiring)
* MST with Fibonacci heap
* Lazy Label Graph. (Single-Source graph with Dijkstra's algorithm)
* A* algorithm
* Parallel queued graph minimization (will need a concurrent mutable edge graph)


Semirings

* More Semirings

Figure out

* path representations on the original graph with hyperedges and multiple edges.

Prim's MST algorithm

Put all the verticies in a priority queue with variable key values
Initialize all the keys to O.
Pick the root and set its key to I.
While the queue is not empty
    extract the minimum edge and node
        if the node isn't in the MST
            for each node reachable from it not currently in the MST
                if some node is closer by using this node
                    replace the key with the closer value
