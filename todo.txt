In this release

* built translator from scala-graph to net.walend.digraph.Digraph and (maybe) back
* optimized digraph representation for algorithms
** Now adapt any graph to use the algorithms, not just scala-graph
* a test of scala-graph translated
* 2.10 and 2.11 versions


For this release

* edges in top-level graph representation
* automatically plot the results of the timing studies (and comparison with Jung)
* profile Floyd
* profile Dijkstra
* profile Brandes

For next release

* publicize on twitter
* blog
* Enron
* path representation for net.walend.digraph
* translator from net.walend.digraph.path to scala-graph's paths

* subgraph representation for net.walend.digraph
* Probabilty semiring


Pulblicize

* Blog a bit

Overall
* Add more to the package doc.

Structures

* MultiPath representation (Probably a subgraph via having)
* Concurrent Graph (Or at least Graph-With-Concurrently-Modifiable-Edges)

Algorithms

* AllPathsBrandes which finds all minimal paths between start and end nodes by supplying a set of possible previous nodes within an Option[BrandesSteps] (currently can only use one Semiring)
* MST with Fibonacci heap
* Lazy Label Graph. (Single-Source graph with Dijkstra's algorithm)
* A* algorithm
* Parallel queued graph minimization (will need a concurrent mutable edge graph)


Semirings

* More Semirings

Figure out

* path representations on the original graph with hyperedges and multiple edges.

Prim's MST algorithm

Put all the verticies in a priority queue with variable key values
Initialize all the keys to O.
Pick the root and set its key to I.
While the queue is not empty
    extract the minimum edge and node
        if the node isn't in the MST
            for each node reachable from it not currently in the MST
                if some node is closer by using this node
                    replace the key with the closer value
